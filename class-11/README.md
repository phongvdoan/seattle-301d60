# Server-side templating with EJS

## Feedback

- Shred talks too early in the day to remember for code challenges
- enjoy hands on activities
- bouncing ideas off the other students
- why doesn't my environment work
- relearning the app each day was tough

## Overview

Today is the first day of our new project, a mobile-only book collection. You will be working with the same partner(s) each day, gradually working towards a full-scale application, complete with server-side templating, persistence in a SQL database, and the ability to search the Google Books API for new books to add to your collection.

## Daily Plan

- Warm-up exercise
- HTML5 Forms
- Server-side templating
- Google Books API
- Code Demo
- Lab Preview
- Introduction of today's code challenge topic

## Learning Objectives

As a result of completing lecture 11 of Code 301, students will:

- Understand how to architect a full-stack web application
- Create a schema to model data
- Interact with the Google Books API to search for books based on user queries
- Display API results to the user, hiding certain details for a smooth user experience
- Be able to dynamically render information to the user through the use of a server-side templating library
