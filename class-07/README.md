# APIs and Promises

## Overview

Today we will continue to work with third-party APIs to request data. Part of being a software developer involves continuous improvement and refactoring of the code base. We will discuss how and when to refactor our code today.

## Daily Plan

  - tas are super helpful / on point
  - learning front end instead of back end
  - enjoyed the readings and the grid/flexbox online excercises
- Functional programming concepts
- Code Demo
- Lab Preview
